Each example contains its own copy of Caterwaul and all dependencies, so
running them is straightforward; for example:

$ node clock.js

Some of the examples will do better in the right terminal mode. Unfortunately,
node.js programs don't have access to termios without using C extensions. I've
gotten around this by wrapping the node.js programs into self-modifying Perl
files that invoke stty for you. You can run them like this:

$ ./clock test
